Status: Incomplete

Purpose:  Transmit all ticks and other events to listeners

Usage:
    Using the linkmq5 Expert Advisor, set it up to be the client or server. Starting the EA should get everything talking.

Notes:
    Created on Linux using mingw and tested on a Wine installation of MetaTrader 5

Ideas:
- Messages should be versioned, and/or be in JSON
- Perhaps the clients should state their version.
